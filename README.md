# Task-list
A simple task list with an rpg spin (WIP) You will need Tkinter and PIL installed.

# What is this?
A small python script that lets you add and remove tasks to different list types. You can add your own list categories too if you like! There's also a cute goat that levels up as you aim to do things, and he gets new outfits. I made this because I needed a focus to-do list but I also like a little bit of gamification, but didn't want to go overboard.

# Adding new categories:
Just put a new text file in the lists folder, and it'll show up.

# Can I reskin this to change the character or UI?
Go for it! Just be aware this is written with Tkinter, and gif handling for transparency in non existent, so you'll need to pay a lot of attention to where bits of the ui are placed aand how the graphics are constructed.

# To-do
- Add more goat variations
- Tidy up the gif handling
- Adjust XP curve
